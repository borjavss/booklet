Prior to The Flatiron School, Ruthie was a research analyst on the digital strategy team at Publicis Kaplan Thaler, an advertising agency in New York. She graduated from Princeton in June 2012 with a B.A. magna cum laude in Anthropology and Certificates in Environmental Studies and Film/Video Production. While at Princeton, she conducted original research for her senior thesis on climate change in the Maldives, filmed and produced documentaries on bellydancing in Alaska and jewelry in Israel, led peers on civic engagement trips across America, and organized events at the Princeton University Art Museum. In her summers, she helped develop a platform for user-generated climate content; and worked as a consulting intern for the International Water Management Institute in India, interviewing stakeholders and conducting user experience surveys for knowledge product development. She has always been interested in how people engage with information that challenges them, and in bridging between technical and non-technical thinkers. She is excited to leverage those experiences and interests as a developer."

bio: "Nothing makes David happier than collaborating side-by-side with bright, creative people building very cool things while learning as much as he can in the process. \r\n\r\nOriginally from South Florida, David attended the University of Florida (after brief stints pursuing becoming an airline pilot and a marine biologist) where he earned a degree with honors in electrical engineering. After graduating, he moved to Dallas to work for Accenture, where he quickly moved up the ranks as a technology consultant. At Accenture he worked on wide variety of large scale IT design and integration projects for Fortune 500 companies. Following Accenture, David joined Bank of America’s Technology Operations group where he managed technology implementation projects at the two largest check-processing centers in the United States.  (Los Angeles and San Francisco, if you're wondering.)\r\n\r\nAfter Bank of America, David performed a career “pivot” moving back to Florida and becoming a high school mathematics teacher. He taught AP Calculus at a large, public high school in Miami and later moved to New York City where, until recently, he taught at a private high school in Brooklyn working with students with documented learning disabilities. Today, David, spends his time (a lot of it) at the Flatiron School working hard to sharply hone his software and web development skills and knowledge - all in preparation for soon joining an innovative, cutting-edge company in defining and building the future of the Internet.\r\n\r\nWhen not coding, debugging, experimenting, tinkering, reading, or trying to come up with the next big thing, David enjoys technical photography, watching food shows with his beautiful fiancé, and exploring the world around us."

As an enthusiastic tech team member of MPowered organization on campus, she pounces on the opportunity to help foster student entrepreneurship and pursuit of opportunity via start-up bootcamps, hackathons, pitch summits and more. \r\n\r\nDuring her summers here in NYC, she hasn't ever strayed far from the buzzing tech scene. She was a product management intern for both Animoto and Grovo analyzing inventory statistics, running user tests, and whatever else these go-getter companies needed. When she's not running between events, she loves to strum her ukulele, start and finish a book in one sitting, hum acapella harmonies, kickbox early in the day, travel like anything but a tourist, and of course, enjoy all the food along the way."
