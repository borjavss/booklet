bio: "Nothing makes David happier than collaborating side-by-side with bright, creative people building very cool things while learning as much as he can in the process. \r\n\r\nOriginally from South Florida, David attended the University of Florida (after brief stints pursuing becoming an airline pilot and a marine biologist) where he earned a degree with honors in electrical engineering. After graduating, he moved to Dallas to work for Accenture, where he quickly moved up the ranks as a technology consultant. At Accenture he worked on wide variety of large scale IT design and integration projects for Fortune 500 companies. Following Accenture, David joined Bank of America’s Technology Operations group where he managed technology implementation projects at the two largest check-processing centers in the United States.  (Los Angeles and San Francisco, if you're wondering.)\r\n\r\nAfter Bank of America, David performed a career “pivot” moving back to Florida and becoming a high school mathematics teacher. He taught AP Calculus at a large, public high school in Miami and later moved to New York City where, until recently, he taught at a private high school in Brooklyn working with students with documented learning disabilities. Today, David, spends his time (a lot of it) at the Flatiron School working hard to sharply hone his software and web development skills and knowledge - all in preparation for soon joining an innovative, cutting-edge company in defining and building the future of the Internet.\r\n\r\nWhen not coding, debugging, experimenting, tinkering, reading, or trying to come up with the next big thing, David enjoys technical photography, watching food shows with his beautiful fiancé, and exploring the world around us."

As an enthusiastic tech team member of MPowered organization on campus, she pounces on the opportunity to help foster student entrepreneurship and pursuit of opportunity via start-up bootcamps, hackathons, pitch summits and more. \r\n\r\nDuring her summers here in NYC, she hasn't ever strayed far from the buzzing tech scene. She was a product management intern for both Animoto and Grovo analyzing inventory statistics, running user tests, and whatever else these go-getter companies needed. When she's not running between events, she loves to strum her ukulele, start and finish a book in one sitting, hum acapella harmonies, kickbox early in the day, travel like anything but a tourist, and of course, enjoy all the food along the way."

bio: "Although Sagar spent the majority of his childhood in New Jersey, he still likes to believe that the first three months of his life in Queens qualify him as a true New Yorker. After a brief stint attending school in Boston, Sagar had enough of life outside of the tri-state area and transferred to New York University's Stern School of Business. Although New York always feels like home for Sagar, he does love to travel. While at NYU, Sagar got the opportunity to travel to Buenos Aires, Argentina and Mumbai, India as part of his curriculum. In Mumbai, Sagar participated in an exchange program and learned about economic development in the complicated and chaotic country that is India. In Buenos Aires he just partied for a week and it was awesome.\r\n\r\nSagar graduated NYU in 2010 with a degree in finance and economics. Afterwords, he worked in consulting helping clients make financial decisions using valuation techniques. Sagar could value almost anything for you. Ultimately, Sagar realized that he had a real interest in programming. He can't resist the joy of building fun programs and solving the interesting problems that come along with them. \r\n\r\nWhen Sagar is not programming, you can find him playing basketball against people a foot taller than him, decompressing with a good sitcom, or listening to TED talks or This American Life."

bio: "Matthew Schmaus has always gravitated to hobbies that required analytical and structured reasoning skills. As a young child, Matt spent countless hours building with Legos, assembling backyard furniture sets sans instruction manuals, wiring his childhood home for internet and cable, and taking apart (and improving!) the family computers. Those pastimes led him to enroll in the Academy for Telecommunication and Computer Science, a Bergen County Academies high school. There, Matt's technical exposure began with Java, HTML/CSS, Oracle database design, and Cisco networking fundamentals. \r\n\r\nAfter graduating high school, Matt attended the Olin Business School at Washington University in St Louis, majoring in Economics and Entrepreneurship. Outside of class, he owned and operated Bears’ Bikes bicycle shop, served as president of his fraternity (Sigma Chi), and was the co-founder of the WashU Student Entrepreneurial Program’s Chamber of Commerce.\r\n\r\nDuring his senior year, Matt and his friend Brian developed a business plan for Flash It, LLC, a company focused on offering consumer tracking services to small businesses for customer management and individualized marketing. Brian was in charge of the technical side of the business; Matt was responsible for sales and operations. Unable to test and release a solid product, Flash It failed (fast). Realizing he wanted to be the one building, failing, and building again, Matt returned to his first love, technology, to arm himself with the skills to make it happen."

bio: "Educated in the United States and Switzerland, Alisa speaks fluent English, French and conversational Italian. She has undergraduate degrees in Art Studio and Art History, and an MBA in Entrepreneurship & Finance.\r\n\r\nAlisa kicked off her professional life as a temp clerk at The New York Times Quality Assurance department.  This was supposed to be an interim position until a graphic designer position opened up, but it turns out that clerical work consists of a lot of downtime.  Wanting to know more about what she was doing and why, she became absorbed with learning all aspects of print reproduction and was soon invited to manage the QA department.  This trajectory gradually led Alisa to a Senior Management position of Process Improvement Director, in which capacity she led the continuous improvement strategy and helped solve complex technical problems.\r\n\r\nKeenly aware of the decline of the newspaper industry, she knew she had to explore opportunities in and outside of The Times to a) keep her skills up-to-date, and b) home in on her strongest areas of interest.  While working full-time, she completed two Culinary School degrees, received an MBA, and co-launched a Baby subscription startup.  This journey has led Alisa to realize that she wants to be in the business of building cool stuff that solves real problems, and this is how she ended up at the Flatiron School. When she's not learning how to code, you'll likely find Alisa in her aquaponic greenhouse or cooking up a storm."

bio: "Max grew up in suburban Westchester, New York and had a solid public school education which included just a little computer science. Mainly a typing class. That was great. He liked to type fast before he knew what to type. There was also an introductory C++ class which he did pretty well in. Then he and a friend made a Mario rip-off game in a pirated copy of Flash which didn't get \"blammed\" from Newgrounds, which he figured was his peak as a programmer, so he went to The University of Vermont and made a bunch of short films and wrote a bunch of short stories and maybe one poem.\r\n\r\nAfter college, in the \"real world\", programming slowly crept back into his life. A few of his high school friends had stuck with it and were now working in the industry and it seemed very exciting to dust off the old keyboard and see if any of the old concepts had stuck to his ribs. Besides, during those years, software had become the most exciting popular expressive medium to him. The same way, when he first got an iPod with a hard drive he suddenly had a furnace to feed albums into and a way to care deeply about more artists (one of the best compliments he's every received: 'wow, you have the best iTunes library I've ever seen'), iOS and the new age of web applications opened the doors for him to care about independent developers and tools that seemed tailor-made for him and people like him. So whenever he wasn't working for his dad at the ribbon company, he was reading and experimenting and eventually attending meetups and doing a little tutoring and now he's at Flatiron School, where his learning has hyper accelerated."

bio: "Sarah was brought to coding by both her prior work in media and a lifelong fascination with technology and its ever-increasing impact on our lives. Though always buoyed by a great passion for the arts, Sarah eventually reached a point where her mere proximity to creativity as a sales analyst was no longer enough. This, coupled with the sneaking suspicion that there was in fact a better way to complete the repetitive aspects of her work in ebooks and ecommerce caused her to dig deeper into the world of macros, automation, and later code.\r\n\r\nInitially it was exposure to the fields of user research and usability testing that sparked the idea of one day marrying her previous studies in psychology with her interest in digital culture. But after having personally witnessed the effects of disruptive technologies first upon music and then the publishing industry, Sarah began to see coding as more than just a passing interest and instead a downright necessity and future career path.\r\n\r\nUltimately Sarah hopes to work on products that harness the power of technology for good and make real life better. In her spare time she can be found preparing overly-complicated recipes and stalking the local greenmarkets for the arrival of the latest short-season produce. \r\n"
